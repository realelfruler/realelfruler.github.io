The two figures are posed like Gustav Klimt's 'The Kiss,' both kneeling, with the one on the left holding the face of and kissing the figure on the right, who has their arms around the left figure. The left figure in this painting is Phoenix Wright from the 'Ace Attorney' series, wearing a white t-shirt and gray sweatpants. He has visible body hair on his arms and stomach, and stubble on his face. The right figure is Miles Edgeworth, who is wearing a long-sleeve white button-down shirt, pink suit pants, wingtip shoes, and blue socks. Both have golden haloes behind their heads." height="775px">
