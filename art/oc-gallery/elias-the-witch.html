        <img src="../../images/ocs/elias-the-witch-ref.png" alt="A digital drawing on a warm, light gray background. On the left side of the canvas is a person wearing light blue pajamas, standing at a 3/4 angle, looking towards the viewer's left. Their skin and long brown hair, which floats behind their head, has a blueish tint to them. They are barefoot, and their arms hang at their sides. They have a scar on their face, and bright green spirals in place of irises in their eyes. On the right side of the page is a description, with the title 'Elias The Witch: 1760-1783' written above it in cursive. The description is three bullet points, also in cursive: Gay trans man; Enlisted in the Continental Army to escape a toxic relationship; Killed by the Spanish Inquisition after moving to New Mexico. Below these are two headshots of Elias at different stages of his life. The top one shows him with a bandage across his face, with hazel eyes and his hair in a loose ponytail, labeled '1777: 17 years old.' He's wearing a blue coat and red vest over a white collared shirt. The bottom one shows him with his hair hidden under a green scarf, wearing a feminine-style neckerchief. This is labeled '1775: 15 years old.'" height="775px">
