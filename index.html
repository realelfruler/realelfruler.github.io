The figure on the left has dark skin, dark green hair, and brown eyes, and is wearing a white shirt with a gold collar, and a short, green vest over it. He's also wearing green pants and knee-high brown boots. He's wearing a piece of white fabric that drapes over his nose and mouth. In his right hand is a glass orb, which the figure on the right has his hand over. The figure on the right is very pale, with lilac-colored hair and small antlers, and small green triangles tattooed under his eyes, with green lines that extend down to his jaw from the triangles. He has very pale blue eyes, and is staring directly at the viewer. He's wearing a gold collar that extends a bit down his chest. He is also wearing a green scarf, over a white wrapping that covers his chest, but exposes his stomach. He's wearing a blue sash that's tucked in the front of his blue skirt. He has no shoes, and anklets the same gold as his collar. In his right hand is a staff with a large bird skull on top. Both figures are wearing gold circlets, and have tattoos of suns between their eyebrows.">
